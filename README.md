# cafe-panel-system
A contactless prototype 3-screens system for a Coffee shop, being 2 screens for end-users (one to require (through QR Code) /follow your order and another register it and the last one is for production team, a kanban board to manage the orders' status.

Zip contains a SQL file to generate the DB and table for this project.

This is actually my first project here, it is in early stages of production, that's why I called it, for now, a prototype. I intend to update it as long as I have any progress till it's clean and done.
